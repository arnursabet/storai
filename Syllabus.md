### **Course Description**
This course introduces students to the design and development of applications leveraging large language models (LLMs) for therapists. The curriculum covers core LLM concepts, privacy frameworks in healthcare, technical implementation, and application development. Students will gain hands-on experience by building a prototype application while addressing privacy, security, and ethical considerations.

---

### **Course Learning Objectives**
By the end of this course, we will:  
1. Understand foundational concepts of LLMs, including prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).  
2. Explore privacy-preserving strategies and regulatory frameworks (e.g., HIPAA) for healthcare applications.  
3. Develop skills in modern web/mobile/desktop app development and system design principles.  
4. Build a prototype application integrating LLM functionality with placeholder data.  
5. Learn MLOps practices for deploying and maintaining LLM-based applications.
